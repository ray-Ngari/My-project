# Overview  
The project explores and analyzes an aviation dataset to identify **key contributing factors to accidents, emerging trends, and high-risk locations**. The project provides stakeholders (such as airlines and regulatory bodies) with **valuable insights to reduce accidents and improve protocols** by applying statistical and data visualization techniques.  

## Business Understanding  

**Safety in the aviation industry is a serious concern for stakeholders.** Producing **data-driven insights** helps stakeholders make informed decisions in risk management. **Analyzing factors contributing to accidents, patterns in accidents and fatalities, and high-risk locations** improves operational efficiency and safety measures and reduces risks.  

In aviation, stakeholders include **insurance companies, aircraft manufacturers, airport authorities, airlines, and regulatory bodies**.  

### Key Business Questions:  
1. **Which regions (countries and locations) have the highest risks of accidents?**  
2. **Is there an increase or decrease in aviation accidents and fatalities?**  
3. **What factors cause or contribute to accidents (weather, mechanical failures, human error)?**  
4. **How can stakeholders leverage data-driven insights to improve safety in the aviation industry?**  

## Data Understanding and Analysis  

### Source and Description of Data  
The aviation dataset is **generated by the NTSB (National Transportation Safety Board)**. The data comes from the **NTSB database**, which contains information on **accidents and selected incidents in the U.S. and international waters from 1962 to the present**. However, this dataset focuses specifically on the period from **1962 to 2023**.  

The database is normally updated within a few days with the **preliminary report of an accident**, which is later replaced with **factual information when the investigation is complete**. Most cases before **1993** lack full descriptions because the **NTSB did not have primary investigative responsibilities**.  

### Method  
The project uses **descriptive analysis, inferential statistics, and data visualization** to explore the data and provide an overview of the dataset.  

## Results  


- **The top three aircraft with the highest accident counts are:**  
  - **Cessna (26,522 accidents)**  
  - **Piper (14,557 accidents)**  
  - **Beech (5,138 accidents)**  
- The **Cessna 152 is the model with the most accidents**.  
- **Aircraft with one engine have the most accidents**.  


- **The United States has the highest accident count**, with over **79,000 accidents in 61 years**.  
  - This is **over 200 times** the number of accidents in **Brazil**, which has the second-highest accident count.  
  - **In the USA, Anchorage, Albuquerque, and Houston** are the locations with the highest accident counts.  

- **Trends in Accidents and Fatalities**  
  - **The blue line shows the trend of accident counts, which seems to be reducing over time.**  
  - **The orange line shows fatalities, which fluctuated significantly from 1980 to 2000**, despite a decline in accidents. This suggests that some crashes were highly severe.  
  - **After 2000, fatalities showed a decreasing trend**.  

## Conclusion  

- **Aircraft make and model are key mechanical factors contributing to accidents**.  
  - **Cessnas, especially the Cessna 152, are more likely to be involved in accidents**.  
  - **Aircraft with one engine have over an 80% chance of getting into accidents**.  
  - Although the **exact phase in which most accidents occur is unknown, a significant number occur during landing**.  

- **Weather is not a major contributing factor to accidents**.  
  - **Most accidents occur when the weather is clear enough for the pilot to navigate**.  

- **Most accidents occur in the USA, especially in Anchorage, Albuquerque, and Houston**.  
  - Possible reasons:  
    - **High air traffic volume**  
    - **Diverse weather conditions**  
    - **Major aviation hubs**  
  - **Improved safety measures and stricter regulations can help reduce risks in these high-incident areas**.  

- **Accidents and fatalities have been reducing over time**.  
  - **Fatalities fluctuated significantly from 1980 to 2000**, despite a decline in accidents, indicating that **some crashes were highly severe**.  
  - **After 2000, fatalities have shown a declining trend**, reflecting **advancements in aviation safety and emergency response**.  
  - **Accidents peaked around 1980 but showed a steady decline over time**, suggesting **improvements in aviation safety and regulations**.  
  - **Despite occasional fluctuations, the overall trend indicates a reduction in aviation incidents**.
